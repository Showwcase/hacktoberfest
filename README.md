# What is Hacktoberfest?
`Hacktoberfest` is a celebration of Open Source. It is a virtual event organized by DigitalOcean and its partners throughout October. It is aimed toward open source and introducing it to as many developers as possible. Read more about the event from [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

## Hacktoberfest with Showwcase

We at Showwcase encourage every developer to contribute to Open Source through Hacktoberfest. We are excited to participate in the event to encourage open-source enthusiasts to make `low-code` contributions with content creation. 

`Showwcase` is the platform for developers to learn, share, and grow. One of the prominent avenues for developers to learn and grow is with the `shows` in Showwcase. With shows, you can create blog articles, videos, podcasts, and many other content types that are free to consume.

In this Hacktoberfest, you can create any type of show and make a `low-code` contribution to Hacktoberfest. Read below to get started.
